# Linux Kernel Modules

## Requirements
To compile Linux device drivers on your system,
you must install Linux'sheaders with the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

If you have many versions of GCC installed,
you can use the following command to specify the exact version of GCC in the build procedure.

```sh
make CC=/usr/bin/gcc
```

After successful compilation of kernel module you can insert it with the following command:

```sh
sudo insmod hello.ko
```

Then you can use `dmesg` to see the system logs.

```
106745.687281] hello: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.
[106745.687321] hello: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel
[106745.688081] Hello, I am loading
```

In the end, you can remove it and see its logs again.

```sh
sudo rmmod hello
```

```
[106957.018862] Goodbye, i am unloading
```
